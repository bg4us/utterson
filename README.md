Utterson - contact form processing
----------------------------------

This is an open source tool for static sites (Jekyll, etc.) where you want 
to have a simple contact form that will be forwarded to your email.

We developed this for our own sites, and you are welcome to use our running
instance in heroku by registering.  You can inspect the code on github.  We
promise, we are not going to spam you, use the email addresses you collect,
or do anything evil.  Inspect the code on github, or if you still feel uneasy
about using our server, create a free Heroku account and roll your own.
